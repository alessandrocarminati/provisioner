# goinit
## Introduction
`goinit` is a task-specific Linux init implementation aimed at mimicking the unikernel strategy within a traditional Linux kernel environment. 
It is designed to execute "flashing" actions, such as fetching and writing the root filesystem, boot items like device tree, U-Boot environment variables, or kernel image. 
The project's goal is to simplify and standardize these tasks within a Linux environment.
`goinit` is integrated into the Linux kernel and replaces the typical initramfs. 
It can be embedded into the kernel image, allowing U-Boot to fetch and execute the kernel. 
U-Boot controls `goinit` using kernel arguments in the format `pr.<command>=value`.

## Build
To build the `goinit` project, follow these steps:

Download the Repository: Clone the `goinit` repository from the source repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/alessandrocarminati/goinit
```
Replace `https://github.com/alessandrocarminati/goinit` with the URL of the repository.

Build the Project: Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and run the following command to build the project:

```
make
```

This command compiles the source code and generates the necessary binaries.
Retrieve the Root Filesystem `rootfs.cpio`: After the build process completes, you can find the root filesystem `rootfs.cpio` in the `bin` directory of the project.
The `rootfs.cpio` file contains the root filesystem required for `goinit` operation.

With these steps completed, you have successfully built the `goinit` project and obtained the root filesystem required for further usage.

## Kernel Integration
For `goinit` to be functional, it must be integrated with a working kernel for the board. 
The Linux kernel provides a configuration option that facilitates this integration. 
Ensure that your kernel configuration includes the following items:

```
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE="<path to the cpio>"
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID=0
CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_GID=0
```
* `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`: This option specifies the path to the root filesystem `rootfs.cpio` generated by `goinit` during the build process.
* `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_UID`: Sets the UID (user identifier) of the root user in the initramfs to 0 (root).
* `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_ROOT_GID`: Sets the GID (group identifier) of the root user in the initramfs to 0 (root).

By configuring the kernel with these options, the resulting kernel image will include `goinit` embedded within it. 
This kernel image will be recognized as a "U-Boot executable," allowing U-Boot to fetch and execute it accordingly.
Ensure that you build the kernel with these configurations to produce a kernel image that incorporates `goinit` seamlessly.

## Usage
Supported Kernel Arguments
* `pr.ifname`: Specifies the interface to bring up (supports DHCP only).
* `pr.syslogIP`: Specifies the syslog server to send message logs.
* `pr.action`: Specifies the action to execute (e.g., flashRootfs, writeKernel, writeDTB, writeUbootEnv, Reboot, etc.).
* `pr.actionArgx`: Represents arguments passed to the action specified by pr.action.
* `pr.debuglevel`: Adjusts the debug level of goinit.
* `pr.reboot`: Instructs goinit to reboot the system after completing its tasks.
* `pr.apiPort`: Port for the HTTP control API (default: 8080). Used only when `pr.ifname` is set.

### Control API (when management interface is up)

After boot, if `pr.ifname` is set and DHCP succeeds, goinit starts a small HTTP server so the board is controllable:

* **GET /api/stat** — Returns a JSON summary: CPU, memory, storage (SCSI/solid/raw block devices), and network (interfaces and management IP).
* **GET /api/read?device=/dev/sda** — Reads the given block device and returns its contents (e.g. save to file).
* **POST /api/write?device=/dev/sda** — Writes the request body to the given block device (e.g. flash an image).
* **POST /api/reboot** — Reboots the board.

### Reporting management IP to provisioner

At boot end (after DHCP and before waiting for Ctrl-C), goinit prints on **stdout** two lines in a fixed format so the provisioner can parse them (e.g. from serial or syslog):

```
PROVISIONER_MGMT_IF=<interface name>
PROVISIONER_MGMT_IP=<assigned IP>
```

`goinit` is developed as part of the automation process for the provisioner tool, serving as the provisioner agent on the board.
